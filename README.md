# Webasto-Heater---Replacement-Controller - V3
An Arduino M0 WiFi based controller for Webasto C/E Diesel Water Heaters

At the moment, this is just a placeholder for the next version.
It's based on the new Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi - which as you might have guessed, has WiFi on board!

The main difference however, is it includes an ACS711 Current sensor in line with the Glow plug.  This is to measure the current & calculate the resistance of the plug.

It's resistance is proportionalt to the exhaust temperature - so this can be used in place of an external sensor.  It's how the original controller works.
The code needs a fair bit of re-writing though.  I'll upload it once it's stable.
